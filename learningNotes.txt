JAVASCRIPT:
Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg 

What I have learned:
1. Data types in javascript are: undefined, null, boolean, string, symb-
   ol, number, and object
2. There are three ways to declare a variable: var, let, and const
    - If you don't use any keywords when initializing a variable, it
      will be global!!
    - let doesn't allow you to declare a variable twice
    - If you assign an array to a const, you can still change the elem-
      ents in the array through their indeces 
        - You have to do Object.freeze(constName)
3. Putting semicolons when lines end is not requireded, but it's a good 
   practice
4. You can include "" in your string without having to type \ if you
   use '' to form the string. To include both '' and "", use ``
5. Strings are immutable :( you can't change letters by accessing their
   index place
6. Elements in arrays can be any data type (mixed, like Python)
    - You CAN modify elements through their indeces with arrays, unlike
      with strings
7. You can use arrayName.shift() to remove and return the first element
   (like pop())
    - arrayName.unshift() adds something to the beginning of an array
8. There is a strinct equality operator ===, which also checks for the
   type equality 
    - Ex 3 == '3' is true, while 3 === '3' is false
9. Objects are basically dictionaries
    - You can use dot notation (obj.key) or bracket notation (obj[key])
        - When there is a space in your key name, you need to use brac-
          ket notation
    - You can also use dot notation to change the object values
    - Remove elements with the keyword "delete"
    - Check if an object has a key with obj.hasOwnProperty(key)
10. You can use the || operator to assign a value if what you're looki-
    ng for doesn't exist alredy
11. You can have multiple ternary operators
    - ex: return num > 0 ? "positive" : num < 0 ? "negative" : "zero"
12. Lambda function syntax: var res = (param1, param2) => new Obj(param1, param2)
    - A good indication of when to use them is if a function takes ano-
      ther function as a parameter
    - If you're just passing in one parameter, you don't need the pare-
      nthesis
13. Rest operator ... makes it so that arguments passed into a function
    are converted into an array 
    - Only works this way if it's in the parameters of a function!
14. Spread operator ... makes a copy of the elements in an array
    - Useful for assigning existing array variables to other variables. 
      Setting arr2 = arr1, for example, would make it so that whenever
      you modify arr1, arr2 will also change
    - Ex. arr2 = [...arr1]
15. Destructuring assignment: for when you want to assign elements in
    an object/array to a variable
    - Syntax obj ex.:
        var voxel = {x : 3.6, y : 7.4, z : 6.54};
        const {x : a, y : b, z : c} = voxel;  // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54
    - Syntax arr ex.:
        const [z, x, , y] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; 
        console.log(z, x, y)  // output: 1 2 4
16. Template literals: allow you to plug in code elements directly into
    a string 
    - Ex.
        const person = {
            name: "Pee Sanchez"
            age: 38
        };

        const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
        I am ${person.age} years old.`  // Notice it's multi-line


EXTENSION:
Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4

1. Every extension is going to have a manifest.json file. These are ve-
   ry important.
    - Contents
        - Service worker: new in Manifest V3. They are files that run
          separately from the main browser thread (cannot access conte-
          nts of a webpage)
        - Default popup: defines what file will work as UI
2. Mental note: study other methods in the chrome API
3. You can use the console in the "inspect element" section for finding
   out the class names for objects in a website
4. What does it mean for a function to be asynchronous?
5. When would you want to export a function? (like in utils.js)
6. When is it necessary to use JSON.parse as opposed to just a string?
7. Why does the if-statement in popup.js need to check for both sectio-
   ns of the URL?
8. Wtf is happening with the chrome.storage.sync.set and get processes
   in contentScript.js?


Debug notes:
- Correctly goes into the if-statement in popup.js' document.addEventListener() function when you have a YouTube video open.
- Correctly identifies that there are bookmarks in viewBookmarks' if-statement
- Bug is probably in addNewBookmark
- Bug is most likely happening when appending the children to bookmarksElement in addNewBookmark
